# student_performance_analysis

### Description

This project involves analysis of student scores in three subjects: Math, Writing, and Reading. This project showcases my proficiency in handling and evaluating student performance data across multiple subjects. By examining the scores in these three areas, I aimed to gain insights into individual student strengths and areas for improvement, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive understanding of student achievement.
